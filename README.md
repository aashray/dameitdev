This is a prototype a Designer bags website that I was asked to make as a freelancer. Basically front-end stuff. JavaScript and HTML5/CSS3 things. I learnt a lot on front-end web development through this.


Please see the finalIdea folder if you want to have a look at the complete website and its code.
